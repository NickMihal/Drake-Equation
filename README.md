<h3><p align="center">:question: What is the Drake equation? :question:</p></h3>

<p align="center"> The Drake equation is a mathematical formula used to estimate the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy. <br>
The equation was first proposed by astrophysicist Frank Drake in 1961 as a way to organize the various factors that could influence the likelihood of the existence of extraterrestrial life. </p>

<b>N</b> = the number of civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy with which communication might be possible <br>
<b>R</b> = the average rate of star formation in our Galaxy <br>
<b>fp</b> = the fraction of those stars that have planets <br>
<b>ne</b> = the number of planets per star that are in the "habitable zone" (where conditions are right for liquid water to exist) <br>
<b>fl</b> = the fraction of those planets on which life develops <br>
<b>fi</b> = the fraction of those planets on which intelligent life develops <br>
<b>fc</b> = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space <br>
<b>L</b> = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space <br>
