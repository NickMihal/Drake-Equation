<h3> What is the Drake equation? </h3>

The Drake equation is a mathematical formula used to estimate the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy. <br>
The equation was first proposed by astrophysicist Frank Drake in 1961 as a way to organize the various factors that could influence the likelihood of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
<br>

<br>
<h3> The Drake equation formula </h3>

<h2> N = R ⋅ fp ⋅ ne ⋅ fl ⋅ fi ⋅ fc ⋅ L </h2>
<br>

<h3> The Drake equation formula explained </h3>

N = the number of civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy with which communication might be possible <br>
R = the average rate of star formation in our Galaxy <br>
fp = the fraction of those stars that have planets <br>
ne = the number of planets per star that are in the "habitable zone" (where conditions are right for liquid water to exist) <br>
fl = the fraction of those planets on which life develops <br>
fi = the fraction of those planets on which intelligent life develops <br>
fc = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space <br>
L = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space <br>
