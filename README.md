<h3> What is the Drake equation? </h3>

The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, <br>
communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy


<h3> The Drake equation formula </h3> <br>

<h3> N = R ∗ fp ∗ ne ∗ fl ∗ fi ∗ fc ∗ L </h3>
<br>


<h3> The Drake equation formula explained </h3>

N = the number of civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy with which communication might be possible <br>
R = the average rate of star formation in our Galaxy <br>
fp = the fraction of those stars that have planets <br>
ne = the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets <br>
fl = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point <br>
fi = the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to develop intelligent life (civilizations) <br>
fc = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space <br>
L = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space <br>
